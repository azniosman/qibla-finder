## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI
- iOS Simulator or Android Emulator (for development)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd qibla-finder
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Run on device/simulator**

   # For iOS
   npm run ios
   
   # For Android
   npm run android
   
   # For web (limited functionality)
   npm run web
   ```

### Environment Setup

The app requires the following permissions and configurations:

#### iOS Permissions
- Location Services (Always and When In Use)
- Background App Refresh
- Notifications

#### Android Permissions
- ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION
- ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION
- VIBRATE
- RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED
- WAKE_LOCK

## Usage Guide

### Getting Started
1. **Location Setup**: Grant location permissions when prompted
2. **Compass Calibration**: Follow the on-screen instructions to calibrate the compass
3. **Prayer Times**: View automatically calculated prayer times for your location
4. **Prayer Tracking**: Tap to mark prayers as completed

### Qibla Direction
- Hold your phone flat and level
- The Kaaba icon will point toward the qibla direction
- Follow the calibration guide for best accuracy
- The app will vibrate when aligned with qibla

### Prayer Management

- **Karachi** (University of Islamic Sciences, Karachi)

## Data Privacy & Storage

- All data is stored locally on your device
- No personal information is transmitted to external servers
- Location data is used only for prayer time calculations
- Export/import functionality for data backup

## Performance Considerations

- **Compass Updates**: Throttled to 60fps for smooth performance
- **Location Caching**: Reduces GPS usage and battery consumption
- **Offline Support**: Works without internet connection
- **Background Processing**: Efficient prayer time calculations
